# Test Case: Bash History Tampering
# Purpose: Detect clearing, modifying, or deleting .bash_history file.

Command run:
    echo "malicious command" >> ~/.bash_history
    > ~/.bash_history      # or delete the file

Expected detection:
- auditd key=bash_history captured the write/delete
- Splunk saved search "bash_history_tamper.spl" shows the activity
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: T1070.003 — Clear Command History
