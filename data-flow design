STEP 1: User performs action on Linux
        → auditd captures event via syscall monitoring

STEP 2: auditd writes logs to /var/log/audit/audit.log

STEP 3: Splunk Forwarder (UF) monitors the file
        → reads new log entries in real time

STEP 4: UF sends logs securely (TCP 9997) to Splunk Indexer

STEP 5: Splunk Indexer:
        • Stores logs
        • Applies parsing rules (props/transforms)

STEP 6: Splunk Search Head:
        • Runs scheduled/real-time detections
        • Maps events to MITRE ATT&CK
        • Triggers alerts

STEP 7: SOC Analyst:
        • Receives alert notification
        • Opens dashboard to investigate
        • Reviews event fields
        • Determines severity and response
